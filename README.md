# Frackman
UCLA CS32 Winter Quarter 2015-2016 Project 

Spec available online at: http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs32/Projects/3/spec.pdf

FrackMan focused mostly on concepts of polymorphism, inheritance, and class structure. 
It challenged us to minimize repetitive code and instead try to use existing functionalities.
This project has not been updated as of the turn in date: 2/26/16.

Most functionality has been implemented but there are still unfinished areas, which are detailed in the "report" uploaded in this repository. 

XQuartz is needed to run the game!
